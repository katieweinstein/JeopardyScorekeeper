# Jeopardy Scorekeeper

Jeopardy Scorekeeper is an in-progress iOS project by Katie Weinstein. It is designed to be a quick and easy way to score at-home Jeopardy games with friends and family by tracking players, games, and scores.

## Installation

Use Node package manager (npm) to install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To test this app on your iPhone, download the Expo Go app. Ensure that your environment and iPhone are connected to the same Wifi network, and then use the following command to start Expo:

```bash
npx expo start
```

Follow the instructions in the terminal or just tap on the project on the Expo Go app.

A window should pop up in your browser as well, so if you'd like to view the app on your computer, you'll have to download a simulator. Please see the [Expo Go installation instructions](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) for more information.
